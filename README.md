<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">3D Battleground Project ðŸŽ®</h1>

Welcome to the 3D Battleground project! This repository is my personal learning space to explore and develop a dynamic 3D game environment using Unity. The game features a battleground where players can engage in combat, test mechanics, and improve gameplay strategies. ðŸš€

<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Features âœ¨</h1>
3D Environment: Immersive battleground arena with realistic terrain and props. <br>
Player Mechanics: Basic player controls, including movement, and combat. <br>
AI Opponents: Enemy characters with simple behavior patterns for engaging battles. <br>
Health System: Players and enemies have a health bar that depletes upon taking damage. <br>
Weapons System: Equip and use weapons to attack enemies. <br>


<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">What I'm Learning ðŸ“š</h1>
Setting up a 3D environment in Unity. <br>
Implementing character movement and physics. <br>
Creating and animating player and enemy models. <br>
Developing combat mechanics (e.g., melee or ranged attacks).<br>
Using Unity's NavMesh for enemy AI pathfinding.<br>
Optimizing game performance and debugging.
